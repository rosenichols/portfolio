			<p>As it was such a nice day, we had our last PAL session outside. It may seem from the pictures I took that the last session was spent playing football, and ok, it largely was, but it was nice to be able to hang out and have some fun. Some of you had presentations straight afterwards, I'm sure that you will have all done well! I brought chocolates for you to share, although I'm not sure everybody got some. This is a shame.</p>
			
			<p>It's been an honour to get to know you guys and I wish you all the best for your second years at university and beyond. Keep in touch!</p>

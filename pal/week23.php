			<div id="announcements">
			<p><span class="date">Please note</span> - Where I have provided answers, I have done so according to the best of my ability and do not claim that they are all correct or that reproducing them in the exam will necessarily get you top marks.</p>
			<p>In the session this week we looked at how we would structure some answers for the Media Tech exam, check back for this soon.</p>

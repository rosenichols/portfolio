			<p>It was brought to my attention that some students were informed that there were no PAL sessions for the first week of the semester. This was not the case, however.</p>
			
			<p>The aim of the first week's session was to give in introduction to what PAL is and why is it beneficial. In addition, an overview of the Introduction to the Web module, including assignments, and of the first year of the Web Design course generally would be considered. It was also an opportunity to agree a plan for the semester's sessions and address any issues arising from your first week at uni. Finally, some ground rules would be set for the sessions.</p>
			
			<h2>What is PAL?</h2>
			
			<p>PAL stands for Peer Assisted Learning.</p>
			
			<p>PAL is about active learning and exploratory discussion. It is confidential - thus a safe place to admit not understanding. Students can decide what is discussed in sessions. The second year students who take the sessions share their insights regarding their experience with the module and the first year generally. They can give tips and give a heads up for potential problems that might be encountered with module assignments. They can also help with exam preparation through looking over past papers.</p>
			
			
			<h2>Ground Rules</h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>We are working collaboratively, not competitively</li>
				<li>We encourage one another to contribute and learn</li>
				<li>Racist and sexist behaviour is not acceptable</li>
				<li>Mutual respect as regards</li>
				<li>Punctuality</li>
				<li>Mobile phones</li>
			</ul>

			<h1 class="first">Week 13 - Welcome back to Semester 2!</h1>
			
			<p>I hope that everyone has had a refreshing break and is excited to be back at uni for the second semester.</p>
			
			<p>For the first week back, we eased back in with a discussion about the previous assignment (feedback not yet received) and collaborated on a plan for the second semester's PAL sessions. There was also opportunity for feedback with regard to the sessions more generally, and it was agreed that I would take more time to cover each subject, and place an emphasis on breaking down code line-by-line and explaining what each bit does. As always, opportunity was given to directly affect the topics covered in the sessions and it was really useful to find out which areas need more attention.</p>
			
			<p>The plan for this semester is roughly as follows:</p>
			
			<p><span class="bold">Weeks 14/15</span> - PHP, introduction and further information<br />
			<span class="bold">Week 16</span> - Overview/differentiation between commonly used coding languages<br />
			<span class="bold">Week 17</span> - CSS navigation techniques<br />
			<span class="bold">Week 18</span> - Possibly book a Mac suite, focus on design<br />
			<span class="bold">Week 19</span> - Possibly jQuery/Javascript<br />
			<span class="bold">Week 20</span> - Open session<br />
			<span class="bold">Week 21/22</span> - Coursework workshop<br />
			<span class="bold">Weeks 23/24</span> - Exam revision</p>

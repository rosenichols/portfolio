<p class="lyricspages">My, my, the time do fly<br />
When it's in another pair of hands<br />
And a loser I will be<br />
For I've never been a winner in my life</p>

<p class="lyricspages">I got used to stressing pain<br />
I used the sucker pills to pity for the self<br />
Oh, it's the animal in me<br />
But I'd rather be a beggarman on the shelf</p>

<p class="lyricspages">Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff<br />
It's the rain before the storm<br />
On a better day, I'll take you by the hand<br />
And I'll walk you through the doors</p>

<p class="lyricspages">Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff<br />
It's the rain before the storm<br />
Don't you let my letter get you down<br />
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you </p>

<p class="lyricspages">My, my, but time do fly<br />
When it's in another pair of pants<br />
And illusion I will be<br />
For I've never been a sinner, la di da</p>

<p class="lyricspages">Don't be so forlorn, it's just the payoff<br />
It's the rain before the storm<br />
Don't you let my letter get you down<br />
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you</p>

<p class="lyricspages">Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down<br />
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you<br />
Don't you let my letter get you down, down, down, down<br />
Don't you, don't you, don't you, don't you</p>

<p class="lyricspages">Down, down, down, down, down, down<br />
Down, down, down, down, down, down<br />
Down, down, down, down, down, down<br />
</p>

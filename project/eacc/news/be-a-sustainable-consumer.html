<h1>Be a Sustainable Consumer</h1>

<p><strong>If everyone consumed the way we do in the UK we would need 3 planet earths!</strong></p>

<p>Our contribution to climate change doesn't just come from our travel, our electricity use and our heating. In fact almost everything we do in our lives involves products or services that have consumed energy to be made or transported, thus emitting carbon dioxide and causing climate change.
We can have a huge positive impact by aiming to live and consume in a "sustainable" way. What's more we won't just make a difference by our own lifestyles, but also from the influence we have on others.</p>
￼
<p><strong>Don't buy things you don't really need or want</strong><br />
Most of us far more 'stuff' than we ever need. Every time you buy a product you're responsible for the emissions due to its manufacture, packaging and transport. So only buy stuff you really need or will actually use.</p>

<p><strong>Buy local food to avoid unnecessary "food miles"</strong><br />
When you buy food from overseas you're responsible for the "food miles" incurred by shipping that product to the UK. Why not reduce your impact on climate change by buying local produce instead? It tastes better too!</p>

<p><strong>Buy organic or grow your own</strong><br />
Conventional intensive farming methods use 25-50% more energy than organic farming per unit of product. Buying organic or growing your own significantly reduces your impact on climate change.</p>

<p><strong>Use a vegetable compost at home</strong><br />
Using a compost for organic waste is easy and avoids it decomposing in landfill sites where it will emit methane, a dangerous greenhouse gas which contributes heavily to climate change. It's also handy to use in the garden.</p>

<h2 class="date">The Carbon Cycle at Erewhon</h2><p class="date">21th March 2010</p>
<img src="images/carboncycle.jpg" />
<p class="newsstory">On Saturday 21st March, twenty cyclists and a toddler in a child-seat from EACC, completed the 157 miles from Machynlleth to Poedeth to publicise the need for cycle-lanes and provision for bikes on public transport. At the Senedd, where ‘the Carbon Cycle’ delivered a petition, cyclists were welcomed by Leanne Wood AM and Gordon James of Friends of the Earth Erewhon. The ride was part of Bike Week and raised money for Oxfam’s work with people worst affected by climate change. Although cyclists endured some hostile motorists and dangerous driving along the way, they thoroughly enjoyed the experience. ‘Every day was an achievement’, said Allison, 'moving slower is so much nicer!'</p>

<h2 class="date">Homeless Polar Bears in Court</h2><p class="date">5th March 2010</p>
<p class="newsstory"><img src="images/homelesspolarbears.jpg" class="floatleft" />Four homeless polar bears appeared before Bristol Magistrates Court today 14th November. We were arrested after blockading the Royal Bank of Scotland corporate offices on Avon St. as part of the National Day of local action on 15th October called by Rising Tide. The day of action was to highlight the role of the Royal Bank of Scotland in financing the oil and gas industry resulting in climate chaos throughout the world.</p>

<h2 class="date">Direct Action stops Shell’s operations in Co. Mayo</h2><p class="date">28th February 2010</p>
<p>
At the end of February, EACC members joined others from around the UK and the Republic of Ireland for a weekend gathering at the Rossport Solidarity Camp at Glengad in County Mayo. The gathering had been called to support the local community in their fight to stop Shell and Statoil from wrecking their environment and destroying their livelihoods of farming and fishing. Shell and Statoil (the Norwegian State oil and gas company) are extracting gas off the coast of Co. Mayo and are now planning to lay a gas pipeline to connect the drilling rig to the gas refinery they are building on seized land at nearby Ballanaboy. The 150 people who came to the gathering took part in direct action workshops led by the Tripod collective from Scotland and learnt from local activists about the massive oil and gas developments planned for the Atlantic seaboard of Ireland. A workshop run by an activist from Platform also showed that the struggle at Rossport was just one of many being waged by small communities around the world against Shell - the multinational oil company. The hallmarks of Shell’s operations are disregard for the environment, destruction of livelihoods, coercion and violence against local activists and gaining favourable terms by giving backhanders to politicians.</p>

<h2 class="date">Sponsored bike ride for EACC</h2><p class="date">25th February 2010</p>
<img src="images/sponsoredbikeride.jpg" />
<p>'On 26th July 2006 I set off from the end of the M27 at the edge of Southampton en route to Glastonbury. I sat on my bike loaded up with panniers and pulling a bike trailer full of tent and bedding stuff. I was allowing 5 days to get there, which I realise was not particularly challenging by professional cyclists standards. However, I am by no definition a ‘professional’ or even an experienced cyclist. I’d only made my decision a couple of weeks beforehand and had done little preparation. I’ve got 2 arthritic knees and was still aching from a minor back injury a few days before. Storms were forecast ahead. Accusations of ‘foolhardiness’ seemed to just fuel the compelling determination I had developed for the journey!</p>

<h2 class="date">'Die-in' at the BP-sponsored Tate Britain</h2><p class="date">Date goes here</p>
<p><img src="images/dieinattate.jpg" /><p>Activists from London Rising Tide staged a 'die-in' in the BP sponsored Tate Britain on 4 January. Bob Jones from LRT said, "We're here to demand that the Tate cut its ties with BP; an art gallery is no place for an environmental hazard such as an oil company".</p>

<p>"BP are here to greenwash their image and distract from the ecological devastation they're causing around the world". The protesters handed out lots of leaflets and urged patrons to demand the end of oil company sponsorship of art galleries.</p>

<p>The 'corpses' were dressed in T-shirts dispalying the logos such as 'Art Not Oil', 'BP - Fossil Fools' and 'BP out of the Tate'. Their epitaphs was fitting for the location. Once dead the staff on site took the precaution of shouting to everybody to leave which only attracted more people, and over 200 flyers were given out inside the building.</p>

<p>Several members of the public were very supportive and even told the staff to stop trying to move us; "these people are making more of a statement than most of the art in this room" was something I heard being said.</p>

<p>We asked the Tate for a representative to discuss the policy of accepting money from social criminals, but they refused as all directors were 'still on holiday'. A shame....and I bet they flew too!</p>

</p>All in all, a good day with excellent public response.</p>

<h2 class="date">Fed Up Polar Bear Disrupts National BBC Wildlife Magazine HQ</h2><p class="date">11th December 2009</p>
<p>On the morning of Tuesday December 11th at 10am, two members of “Arctic Associates” (aka Bristol Rising Tide), and one grumpy refugee polar bear paid a visit to the national offices of the BBC Wildlife Magazine at the top of Tower House in Broadmead, Bristol. More than a hundred employees looked on aghast (some winking in support) as “J. Smith” from Arctic Associates, flanked by Mr. Pole R. Bear, made a long and passionate speech about the sad and dangerous irony of allowing the world’s second largest oil company- responsible for endangering thousands of species through oil spills, toxic pollution, and climate change- to sponsor their Wildlife Photographer of the Year Award Contest, which is coming to Bristol Museum this Saturday December 15th.</p>

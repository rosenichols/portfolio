      <h1>Information Visualisation</h1>

      <p>Most users of the website would be coming to it with no prior knowledge of the data set. In the light of this, I recognised the importance of guiding the user through the steps of using the website, and making it clear what they could do, however I found this a challenge, there being three options a user can choose from at any one time. Their goal would be to inform themselves as to the effects of climate change in a given area.</p>

      <p>I chose to provide simple interaction methods for my users. Each interaction can be carried out with just one click.</p>

      <p>I found it necessary to add clear indications of which state the user is in so that it can be discovered at all times and the user does not get lost. I added arrows as indicators of which sea level the user is viewing, and used underline and a contrasting colour for the data type indicator. The icons used for the water level links on the left hand side clearly represent the rising water level by mapping the user’s mental model of how water rises, with 1 at the bottom rising up to 5 at the top. I used blue to represent water. The icons are slightly beveled as a visible indication they can be pressed. Without these it was much more difficult to remember which information you were looking at.</p>

      <p>I used two different types of chart to illustrate different types of data. In order to aid clarity, I faded out the colours on the bar chart that aren’t currently being represented. The pie charts compliment the information shown on the bar chart by putting the information presented there into perspective.</p>

      <p>Although the layout of the website has no visible boundaries, through the Gestalt principles of proximity and closure, the user’s eye sees the various elements as part of one whole, thus perceiving that the various controls relate to one another. The eye forms closure of the website content through the left and right margins being the same for all elements, and the header and footer forming closure to the top and bottom.</p>


      <h3>Additional Information</h3>

      <p>The statistics for the total population and total land area for the region were taken from Wolfram Alpha (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">http://www.wolframalpha.com</a>), a computational knowledge engine.

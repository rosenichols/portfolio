      <h1>Mini Projects Review</h1>
      
      <p>As a Web Designer, I found the learning outcomes from the second mini project especially helpful. I learnt that sometimes it’s necessary to go back to basics in order to inform higher level decisions. I learnt a lot also in terms of the way I would approach a similar task differently; I would provide more detailed instruction and gather a larger group of participants. I would definitely consider using alternative requirements gathering techniques in the future, I particularly liked the idea of the ‘Five Why’s’ technique.</p>

      <p>The third project made me really think about how I could make the information useful to the user, which metrics they would wish to compare and which conclusions they would wish to draw. Going through the actual process of building a web application made me appreciate more fully what a challenge it can be.</p>

      <h2>2a. Key Positive Aspects of the Interaction Experience</h2>

      <h3>Patient Consultation</h3>

      <p>The main positive aspect from this interaction experience was the ease with which doctors’ and patients’ information could be quickly loaded onto the Microsoft Surface simply by using their respective identification cards. It also demonstrated useful integration with a central database storing all the the patient’s medical details.</p>

      <h3>Retail Banking</h3>

      <p>There were many positive aspects throughout this interaction experience. starting from the use of the internet on the mobile phone. The interactions were quick and responsive to the user’s touch. The user could browse the internet on a whim. Next, with a few taps, the user was able to log into his bank account through the dedicated application, where he is presented with instant access to his accounts. The zoom feature is responsive. There is just one step to locate the nearest branch, as opposed to the usually arduous task of opening the bank account’s website and searching for the facility, typing in a postcode, etc, or even opening a map application and typing in the branch name; the voice control is several times more efficient than either of the aforementioned options in terms of time.</p>

      <p>The payment though NFC (Near Field Communication) is also an infinitely faster option than paying with cash and waiting for change, or paying by card and having to take out your wallet, locate the correct card, etc.</p>

      <p>Inside the bank, having constant and dynamic access to the availability of staff is yet another way in which the technology facilitates a sleek and frictionless experience for the customer.</p>

      <p>Then, through the entire process of dealing with the bank advisor, the user and the bank’s devices work seamlessly with one another, resulting in all parties having a copy of the same information.</p>

      <h2>2b. Interesting Graphical Design Features</h2>

      <p>From a design perspective, I particularly appreciated the clean, black-on-white layout of the native applications on the user’s Windows Phone. A phone screen is still a relatively small area, even with recent advances in pixel density, so the easily readable design makes for a more frustration free experience. It’s true to say that sometimes less is more.</p>

      <p>I also found the design of the bank itself interesting. It would be hard to identify it as a bank based on the paradigms set by banks in this country, although you get the impression they are striving to be like the bank in the video. The space is characterised by large, open spaces, light colours and comfortable furnishings. The open plan feel is complemented by expansive glass panels and light coloured, modern wooden flooring. You get the impression that everyone in society has been thought about, we are given the example of the children’s play area, where the latest technology provides entertainment while the adult goes about his or her business. The meeting takes place in what appears to be a communal area, fitting in with the inclusive theme, customers make use of the desk with plug sockets to use their laptops.</p>

	<h1>Year 2 Web Design, yeah!</h1>
	
	<p><strong>This applies for Web Design students only, sorry BABIS students!</strong></p>
	
	<p>Some of you mentioned to me that it would be useful to be able to get some idea of what will be expected of you when you return for your second year. So, I'll take you through what I did this year and give some advice, however please, please don't take this as set in stone, you will probably end up doing some different things to me.</p>
	
	<h3>My second year modules were:</h3>
	
	<p><a href="#wdp">Web Design Principles (WDP)</a><br />
	<a href="#wp">Web Programming (WP)</a><br />
	<a href="#dsa">Data, Schemas and Applications (DSA)</a><br />
	<a href="#isp">Information Systems Practice (ISP)</a><br />
	<a href="#ia">Information Architecture (IA)</a><br />
	<a href="#hci">Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)</a></p>
	
	<h3>Updates</h3>
	
	<p>23/8/11 - Updated second DSA coursework, added exam info, updated key takeaways, ISP 'by the way'</p>
	
	<p>To be updated: WP, DSA exams.</p>
	
	
	<h3>A quick note on exam revision</h3>
	
	<p>One thing that my year group did for revision which worked really well was to set up a word document on Google Docs and all collaborate. This saved time and effort because each person didn't have to revise the entire syllabus for themselves, plus each person could tackle the area which they had most expertise in. It's worth a go.</p>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>This module was primarily run by Dan Buzzo and Michaela Reiser. I was taught by Michaela, but Dan recorded his lectures and put them online so sometimes I watched these also, particularly when elements of the coursework were being discussed. The sessions were two hours long; the first hour generally spent as a lecture and the second as a coursework workshop once the spec was given out.</p>
	
	<h3>Coursework</h3>
	
	<p>There were two pieces of coursework for this assignment.</p>
	
	<p>According to the spec, the first assignment was given out on 1st November, however it might've been a little later than that, and the deadline was 9th December. The basic premise was to construct a website from a comp image. I've talked about this further on my blog <a href="http://rosenichols.co.uk/blog/2010/12/portfolio-hillfield-aviaries-site/">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The scenario for the second coursework was a new folk festival being set up in Sandford (hence most people's websites - including mine - were imaginatively entitled 'Sandford Folk Festival'). This scenario will very likely change for your year. The coursework was given out on the 17th January. It was split into two parts, the deadline for the first part was 24th February and the second part 24th March.</p>
	
	<h3>Exam</h3>
	
	<p>I really didn't like this exam. It's not that the subject area is hard in itself, but it was necessary to revise twice as much information than you were ever going to need. You'll need a lot of brain space to store it all, so hope that you have a few days to revise before this exam.</p>
	
	<p>It works like this: you will be given a list of questions to revise the answers to. Twenty-four questions in all, I just counted, which in fact means that you'll be revising <em>three</em> times as much information as you'll need, because you'll only be asked to answer eight questions in the exam.</p>
	
	<p>If you're interested, you can find the list of questions that I was given here - <a href="resources/wdp_exam_2011.pdf">wdp_exam_2011.pdf</a></p>
	
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	
	<ul class="nextyear">
	<li>This is one of the only modules you'll take where design is actually important. Use the opportunity to experiment with different design styles and don't be afraid to try something different from everybody else.</li>
	
	<li>Also, keep versions of your work during the second assignment, you'll be assessed on your iterations.</li>

	<li>The exam is hard. You'll revise a lot of stuff that you end up not needing to know. Not for the exam, anyway.</li>
	
	</ul>
	
	
	<img src="images/header_wp.png" id="wp" class="headerimg" />
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>This module kind of speaks for itself. You'll be doing a lot of PHP, a bit of AJAX and XML. It's good stuff to know so stick with it. Run fairly much exclusively by Prakash Chaterjee.</p>
	
	<h3>Coursework</h3>
	
	<p>I only had coursework during the second semester, but this might change for you. The coursework is pretty intense, and most people struggled. You'll be given a choice of subject areas, and told to build an e-commerce website.</p>
	
	<p>The spec explains everything pretty well, so <a href="resources/wp_spec.pdf">take a look at it</a>. Again, though, don't take this as exactly what you'll be doing. It may change completely.</p>
	
	<h3>Exam</h3>
	
	<p>I enjoyed this exam. Weirdly, I think it was one of my best exam marks, even though I tanked on the coursework.</p>
	
	<p>Hm. Goodness knows what I did with the paper, I'll see if I can dig it out later.</p>
	
	
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	
	<ul class="nextyear">
	<li>Invest time in this module; nearly all placements will want PHP.</li>
	
	<li>Get ahead now by learning some advanced PHP over the summer.</li>
	
	<li>Sit at the back in the lectures.</li>
	
	<li>Even if you do badly in the coursework, it can be pulled back in the exam.</li>
	
	<li>There'll be one lecture session towards the end of the second semester that you will not want to miss. In it you'll learn exactly what you should revise.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>I found this module a bit tricky. It is run primarily by Dan Buzzo and Prakash. Each week there's an hour lecture, and every other week a two hour tutorial session. I was timetabled for Buzzo's tutorial session, but I changed to attend Prakash's instead in order to fit in a PAL session on Friday. As long as everybody doesn't change, one or two of you could possibly switch your sessions around should it be necessary, all depending on how your timetables turn out.</p>
	
	<h3>Coursework</h3>
	
	<p>There were two pieces of coursework for this module, one in each semester. The first piece of coursework is conducted in groups. The tutors are pretty fussy about the size of the groups. You must be in a group of 3 ideally, max of 4. I ended up in a group of 4, which worked out ok, but I'd recommend that groups of 3 would've been better; the fewer people there are in a group the less potential there is for arguments. The idea of the assignment is to scrape data from the web and amalgamate several different sources into your website. It's all implicated in the title of the module really. You can <a href="resources/dsa1_spec.pdf">take a look at the spec</a> for more information. Take a look at my coursework <a href="http://www.rosenichols.co.uk/portfolio/twintowns/">here</a> and Steve's <a href="http://www.stevelacey.net/samples/weather/">here</a>.</p>
	
	<p>The coursework in the second semester is individual. The coursework has two parts.</p>
	
	<p><b>Part 1</b> - Reverse engineer a website. Sounds scary, I know because I was scared, but it's really nothing to be afraid of.</p>
	
	<p><b>Part 2</b> - Produce a spec for, or build a website which performs a similar function to the website you did the reverse engineer on. In my case, it was a website to report and locate missing things. Recommended to do the build in PHP, seeing as this is what you'll have been learning all year. See my example here - <a href="http://www.rosenichols.co.uk/portfolio/losttoys/">Lost Toys Site</a></p>
	
	<h3>Exam</h3>
	
	<p>This exam wasn't that hard. The first part is multiple choice, the second part written. You'll get a choice of questions, so you can revise your chosen topics really well. I'll see if I can dig out the paper if I even have it.</p>
	
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	
	<ul class="nextyear">
	<li>Just work through it the best you can. I realise that is rubbish advice.</li>
	
	<li>Don't make life hard for yourself. Where you are allowed to choose your own topics for coursework, keep it simple and do it well.</li>
	<li>The same as WP, this module will have a lecture session towards the end of the second semester where the exam questions will be gone through with you. Do not miss this lecture!</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>You'll meet Nick Plant. I'll leave you to find out about him. You'll probably also meet Peter Rawlings. Same goes. The other person on this module is Paul Hulbert.</p>
	
	<p>At the beginning of the year it'll seem pointless. That won't have changed by the end. That's not to say that you can't get anything from the module though.</p>
	
	<p>A couple of weeks in, maybe a month, you'll be randomly split into groups of around 5 or 6. This module is shared with BABIS and ITMB students so you'll be in with some of each. Once you've been put into these groups, you'll be working together for the rest of the year, so it's worth making an effort to get along. The same day as you're put into your groups, you'll also be assigned a 'host' (for host read client - host is the term used because all of the clients are within the confines of UWE, or something. Anyway, you'll get used to the obscure and confusing business speak).</p>
	
	<p>So, once you've got your host, you go and meet them. They'll want you to improve some aspect of their current information system. I was quite fortunate that my team (group and team will become very familiar terms to you) were assigned a good host in Barney of the drama department at St Matts.</p>
	
	<h3>Coursework</h3>

	<p>What I've already said mostly covers the coursework; the whole thing is kind of the coursework, you'll get a monster spec (must've been 10+ pages) which explains everything you'll have to do. One thing I haven't mentioned is that you'll have to complete logbook entries, three in all, about tasks that you've completed.</p>
	
	<h3>Exam</h3>
	
	<p>Not exactly an exam, but you will have something by way of a final presentation in this module. In it you will essentially lay out what you did, what you learned, that kind of thing. You shouldn't find it too hard. The hardest thing will probably be not losing your will to live, listening to hours of essentially the same presentation over and over. Well, enjoy!</p>
	
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	
	<ul class="nextyear">
	<li>Organisation is key, do something every week.</li>
	
	<li>One thing my team did which worked well is arrange a time to meet, just for an hour, every week. It sounds like a lot of hassle but it's not really, and it'll really help the team to stay on track.</li>
	
	<li>Get on with your team. You'll only be making life hard for yourself otherwise.</li>
	
	<li>Get on well with the host. They'll be talking to the module leaders about how you did.</li>
	
	<li>Get on well with the module. You'll be doing the whole thing again but more in Year 3's Consultancy Project module, only this time with a real world client.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>By the way...</h3>
	
	<p>I understand that PAL sessions will be running for this module for you guys next year. These are being run by the lovely Sarah (who was my PAL Leader in the first year) so please give her your support! :)</p>
	
	
	<img src="images/header_ia.png" id="ia" class="headerimg" />
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>IA is a good module. There's not a whole lot to say about it. Paul Matthews takes the module, he's a great guy, you should follow him on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/paulusm">@paulusm</a>. You'll have a two hour slot each week in which most weeks you'll undertake a tutorial. You pretty much have to just get on with it, but Paul will of course help if you get stuck. You need to do a minimum number in order to pass, I think it's 6. As well as these practicals, you'll be put into groups and assigned IA topics which you will base a 20 minute presentation on - 20 minutes each, so if you're in a group of three, all of your presentations together should total an hour. Near the end of the second semester you'll have your presentations.</p>
	
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	
	<p>This module doesn't require as much to be done outside of class, aside from researching your topic, so if you're organised and get the practicals done inside of timetabled hours, you'll give yourselves more time for the more challenging modules.</p>
	
	<p>Don't freak out about the length of the presentation, you'll have loads to say. Do something interactive with the audience to keep them interested.</p>
	
	<h3>Exam</h3>
	
	<p>This exam was a piece of cake. It's multiple choice, and if you've been paying attention you'll do really well.</p>
	
	
	<img src="images/header_hci.png" id="hci" class="headerimg" />
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	
	<p>The thing that irritated me the most about this module is the hyphen. Seriously, having to hyphen 'Human-Computer' every time gets on my nerves.</p>
	
	<p>Aside from that, I actually enjoyed this module, I found the content really interesting. Not everybody shared my view, however, I'm pretty sure that some on the course thought it was pointless. It depends what you're interested in, I suppose. Unfortunately for me, the two hour lecture was timetabled to start at 9am, and because I commute from Newport it meant I quite often missed the lectures, at least the first hour.</p>
	
	<p>This module deals mostly with usability.</p>
	
	<h3>Coursework</h3>
	
	<p>The coursework for this module is split into four parts.</p>
	
	<p><b>Part 1</b> - Individual. PACT (People Activities Context Technologies) Analysis, much fun, you'll be taught all about how to do this so don't worry. <a href="http://rosenichols.co.uk/images/pact_analysis.png">Take a look at mine (BUT DO NOT COPY)</a>. Additionally, you have to do a piece of work giving examples of visibility, affordances, feedback and mapping. You'll be taught this too.</p>
	
	<p><b>Part 2</b> - Group work. Conduct a co-operative analysis (usability test). Again, you'll be shown exactly how to go about doing this.</p>
	
	<p><b>Part 3</b> - Group work. Presentation based on research you have conducted into touch screen systems. Fun stuff. You have to go into town and test an iPlus machine.</p>
	
	<p><b>Part 4</b> - Individual. Produce a prototype for a touch screen interface. Produce lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes. Do testing. Create personas and scenarios.</p>
	
	<h3>Exam</h3>
	
	<p>I found this exam pretty straightforward, but I can see that if you struggled with the module during the year you could potentially find it really hard. I'll write a bit more about this later.</p>
	
	<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
	
	<ul class="nextyear">
	<li>You'll be given extra reading to do; do it, it'll really help.</li>
	
	<li>If you do well in this module, it'll look good to employers if you're going for that kind of job.</li>
	</ul>

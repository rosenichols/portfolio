		<h2>How does PAL work?</h2>
		
		<p>In each session you will be guided through course concepts by your PAL Leader, a competent student who has previously taken the course and been trained in group facilitation techniques. Your leader will not re-lecture or give you his/her class notes and he/she will not do your homework or your thinking for you.</p>
		
		<p>Sessions are intended to offer a safe and friendly place to help students</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>Adjust quickly to university life</li>
		<li>Improve their student habits</li>
		<li>Enhance their understanding of the subject matter of the course</li>
		<li>Content is based on course materials (handouts, notes, textbooks)</li>
		</ul>

			<h2>Introduction to the Web</h2>
			
			<p>ITTW is a module taught to first year Web Design students at UWE.</p>
			
			<p>Students are taught the basics of web design and coding. A range of coding languages are covered; these include HTML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP.</p>
			
			<p>75% of the module is made up from two equally weighted assignments and the other 25% is from an examination sat in May.</p>
			
			<p>Both assignments involve the creation of websites and allow students to put into practice what is learnt in tutorials and lectures.</p>

			<h2>Peer-Assisted Learning</h2>
			
			<p>Peer Assisted Learning is an academic support scheme where second year students, PAL Leaders, are trained to run weekly study sessions to support the needs of first year students. PAL Leaders pass on their experience and knowledge of the course they have studied to new students starting that course." (<a href="http://www.uwe.ac.uk/pal/about-pal.shtml">Source</a>)</p>

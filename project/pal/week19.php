			<h1 class="first">Continue with coursework or refactor PHP programme</h1>
				
			<p>This week I'm happy for you to use the time to continue with (ideally) your ITTW assignment, or you may work on your Systems Development assignment if you feel you need the time for it.</p>
			
			<p>Of course, I will be on hand to hopefully deal with any problems that you may be having.</p>
			
			<p>If you haven't finished off the PHP work from previous weeks then of course you are welcome to do this.</p>
						
			<h2>Refactor update.php</h2>
			
			<p>If you wish to do this activity, then let me know and I'll give you a worksheet to go through. It's pretty complicated so I'd rather go through it with you than post it up here. Although as usual, after this week I'll put it up on here.</p>

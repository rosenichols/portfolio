		<h1>Camping Info</h1>
		
		<p class="intro">All camping is free at Larmer Tree Festival for tents, caravans and campervans.</p>
			
			<h2>Opening Times</h2>
			
			<p>No new arrivals can be admitted after 10.30pm on any night.  The campsite closes at midday on Monday 10th July.</p>
			
			<p>All camping (tents, caravans and campervans) is included in the ticket price, and is available for the date/s on your ticket only.</p>
			
			<h2>Parking</h2>
			
			<p>Parking is free and it's not more than a five/ten minute walk to the festival entrance. There are allocated parking areas for those camping in tents - for everyone's safety we do not allow cars to unload or stop in roadways or to be parked next to tents.</p>
			
			<h2>Facilities</h2>
			
			<p>There are toilet and shower facilities and ample water points conveniently situated around the camping field. Your camping experience should be a happy and relaxing one.</p>
			
			<h2>Toilet Roll</h2>
			
			<p>Although we try our very best to keep the toilets well stocked, please bring your own toilet roll just in case!</p>
			
			<h2>Cooking and Fires</h2>
			
			<p>Open fires and candles are strictly forbidden for safety reasons. You may use gas or charcoal burning BBQs, but not disposable BBQs - they are an extreme fire risk. Please make sure gas canisters aren't changed inside tents or caravans.</p>
			
			<h2>Security of Cars, Tents and Property</h2>
			
			<p>Our stewarding team and professional security company will keep a watchful eye on the camping fields 24-hours a day, however we cannot accept responsibility for any losses that may occur. As we have experienced thefts in the past, to keep your belongings safe we recommend that you look at our Welfare page for tips and more info.</p>
			
			<h2>Disabled Parking & Camping Area</h2>
			
			<p>The disabled campsite is close to the festival entrance, has adapted toilets (also available within the festival site) and is available to those who book a place in advance. Places in the disabled parking and camping area must be arranged in advance, for info or to book concessionary tickets see our Welfare page.</p>

		<h1>Welfare & Safety</h1>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>Our professional security company will be on duty 24 hours a day making sure you are looked after in the best possible way.  If you have a problem please go to the 24 hour Security HQ next to the Main Entrance to the festival.</p>
		
		<p>Please also help to keep the festival secure and protect yourself by heeding the following advice:</p>
		
		<p>Don't leave valuables unattended in your tent and ensure that you safeguard your property when in your tent.<br />
		Don't bring large amounts of cash, there will be a cash machine on site from Wednesday.<br />
		Don't leave anything valuable in your car and leave your glove compartment empty and open.</p>

		<h2>Families</h2>
		
		<p>Sandford Folk Festival is a family friendly festival. Parents will be offered a wristband for their children on arrival on which they can write their mobile phone number.</p>
		
		<p>Please be aware that child and youth tickets may only be purchased with accompanying adult tickets.  Youth tickets are limited to two per adult ticket, to ensure that all youths are adequately supervised at the festival.  All children and youths at the festival are the responsibility of their accompanying parent/guardian at all times. We have a varied programme of activities for everyone at the festival all included in the ticket price.</p>
		
		<h2>Medical Services</h2>
		
		<p>There will be a team of paramedics and first aiders on site for the duration of the festival, they will be located near to the festival entrance, however they do not keep prescription medication so you should bring your own supply for the festival.</p>
		
		<h2>People with Disabilities</h2>
		
		<p>On site our stewards will do all they can to help you enjoy the festival. There are wheelchair/easy access toilets available in both the festival site and disabled campsite. There will be a viewing platform on the Main Lawn for wheelchair users and people who need to use a chair.</p>
